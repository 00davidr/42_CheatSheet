Shift-and-add multiplication is similar to the multiplication performed by paper and pencil.
This method adds the multiplicand X to itself Y times, where Y denotes the multiplier.
To multiply two numbers by paper and pencil, the algorithm is to take the digits of the multiplier
one at a time from right to left, multiplying the multiplicand by a single digit of the multiplier
and placing the intermediate product in the appropriate positions to the left of the earlier results.

// The LSB of the multiplier register determines whether the multiplicand is added (if set) to the product register
        result = add(result, multiplicand * (multiplier & 1));
// The left shift of the multiplicand has the effect of shifting the intermediate products to the left, just as when multiplying by paper and pencil.

// The right shift of the multiplier prepares the next bit of the multiplier to examine in the following iteration
